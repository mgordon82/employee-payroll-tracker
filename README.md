# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Purpose of this Project

This project works with existing code where javascript was added to add functionality to prompt a user to add employees and their salaries to a table. From there, it would calculate the average of the salaries and add a console log with the average.

This would also pick a random employee from the array and congratulate them for winning a raffle and that information would be displayed in the console.

## How to access

- The project is viewable on [Github Pages](https://mgordon82.github.io/employee-payroll-tracker/)
